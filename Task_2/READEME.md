# Task 2: Data Visualization (Power BI)

## Objective
The goal of this task was to analyze the Superstore sales dataset and create a compelling visual story using a business intelligence tool.

## Tool Used
**Power BI**

## Dashboard Story & Insights
I built a "Sales & Profitability" dashboard designed for an executive or regional manager. The dashboard is interactive and answers key business questions:

1.  **Executive KPIs:** What are our total sales, profit, and overall profit margin?
2.  **Geographical Analysis:** Where are our strongest and weakest markets by sales vs. profit? (A key insight was that some high-sales states had negative profit.)
3.  **Product Performance:** Which product categories and sub-categories are our "Stars" (high profit, high sales) and which are "Problem Children" (high sales, low profit)?
4.  **Time-Series Trends:** How have our sales and profit trended month-over-month, and which segments are driving this growth?

All charts are linked, and the report can be filtered by Region, Segment, and Order Date.
