# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

## Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to discover trends and patterns related to passenger survival.

## Key Insights
1. **Gender:** Females had a significantly higher survival rate (~74%) than males.
2. **Class:** First-class passengers were prioritized during rescue, leading to higher survival rates compared to 3rd class.
3. **Age:** Children (ages 0-10) had a survival advantage, while the elderly had the lowest survival rates.

## Tools Used
- **Python:** Pandas for data manipulation.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib:** For generating visualizations (Bar charts, Histograms, Heatmaps).

## Files Included
- `EDA_Report.pdf`: The human-readable summary of findings.
- `eda_code.ipynb`: The Python script used to generate charts.
- `train.csv`: The dataset used.
