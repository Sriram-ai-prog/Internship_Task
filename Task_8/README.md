# 📊 Task 8: Automotive Sales Dashboard Design

## 📝 Overview
This project focuses on **Visual Storytelling**. The objective was to transform raw sales records into an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to monitor performance at a glance.

Instead of using standard office supply data, I selected the **Automotive & Vintage Car Sales** dataset to demonstrate adaptability across different industry domains. The dashboard highlights Global Sales trends, Regional performance, and Product category dominance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Tool:** Power BI
* **Data Source:** Sample Sales Data (CSV) - Automotive & Collectibles
* **Key Features:** Interactive Slicers, Drill-down capabilities, and Conditional Formatting.

## 📊 Dashboard Components

### 1. Trend Analysis (Line Chart)
* **Visual:** Sales over Time (Year/Month).
* **Purpose:** Identifies seasonality and growth trends.
* **Finding:** Identified consistent spikes in Q4 (October-December), correlating with holiday demand.

### 2. Geographic Performance (Bar Chart)
* **Visual:** Sales by Territory (EMEA, NA, APAC).
* **Purpose:** Compares regional market share.
* **Finding:** The EMEA region competes closely with North America, indicating a strong market for vintage collectibles in Europe.

### 3. Product Composition (Donut Chart)
* **Visual:** Sales by Product Line.
* **Purpose:** Shows revenue distribution by category.
* **Finding:** "Classic Cars" are the dominant revenue generator, significantly outperforming other categories like Trains or Ships.
